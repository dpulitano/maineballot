Town of Durham
Secret Ballot Budget Referendum Informational Sheet

Due to the pandemic, the Town of Durham will not be holding a traditional Town Meeting. On July 14, 2020, the Town
will vote on the municipal budget by secret ballot in conjunction with the State and RSU5 ballots.

***Voting will take place at the AMVETS Post 13 on July 14, 2020***

Virtual Public Hearing on June 9, 2020, at 6:00pm

There will be additional information on our web page at www.durhamme.com and the Durham FaceBook page in the
coming weeks.

The following pages contain what you will see on the ballot. Both the Select Board and the Budget Committee met to change
the original warrant and recommendations due to the pandemic. Many of these questions are different than and replaces the
Draft Warrant which appears in the Durham Annual Report. The intent of these changes is to keep Durham’s tax rate flat this
year.

When the Town “appropriates” an amount the residents are giving the Town permission to spend that amount, “raise” means
the funds will be raised through taxes and “transfer” means the Town will transfer funds from an existing fund (usually a reve-
nue or capital fund).

At the end of the ballot, there are eleven (11) “Business Articles”. These appear on the warrant every year and give the Select
Board authority to transact business for the Inhabitants of the Town of Durham.

Question 1: To see if the Town of Durham will vote to raise and appropriate an amount not to exceed the 2019 Durham Mu-
nicipal Budget for any budget articles not approved.

If any article does not pass, the Town would revert to last years budget. In the following pages you will see last year’s budget.
These figures will not appear in the actual ballot although a copy of this informational sheet will be available upon request.

Question 2: To see if the Town will vote to appropriate and transfer $188,600 from the Public Works Capital Fund for the
purchase of a new truck and snowplow package.

This truck would replace a 20-year old truck. The funds for this truck would not be raised in taxes this year but transferred
from the Public Works Capital.

2019 Budget 2019 Actual 2020 Budget Capital Fund Balance as of 12/31/2019
$220,000 $194,927 $188,600 $308,550

Question 3: To see if the Town will enter into a three year contact with Pine Tree Waste for Curbside Waste and Recycling as
outlined in their Contract Proposal.

Durham’s curbside pickup contract expires June 30, 2020. The proposal for the new contract is for three years and is availa-
ble at the Town Office.

Question 4: To see if the Town will vote to raise and appropriate $255,692 for Solid Waste. Funding Source: Raise $235,003
and transfer $20,689 from the Solid Waste Revenue Fund.

The last solid waste contract was entered into prior to the collapse of the recycling market. This contract reflects a significant
increase due in part by recycling. The proposal includes an automatic adjustment in the case the recycling market improves..

Question 5: To see if the Town will vote to appropriate and transfer $10,000 from undesignated funds for the Emergency
Fund which can be accessed by a majority vote by both the Select Board and the Budget Committee. The balance of the
Emergency Fund as of December 31, 2019, is $6,953.

This article increases the existing emergency fund in case of unforeseen circumstances. As stated in the warrant article, any
expenditures would need to be approved by the Select Board and the Budget Committee.

Question 6: To see if the Town will vote to appropriate and transfer $77,410 from undesignated funds to be applied to the
municipal operating budget. These funds lapsed into the undesignated fund due to an error in the RSUS tax assessment and
are being used to offset a portion of this year’s tax impact.

RSUS5’s last audit caught an error in the school’s assessments for all three towns for their fiscal year 2019/2020. This caused
Durham to raise $77,410 too much in taxes in 2019. This article offsets that error and will decrease the amount raised in taxes
this year by $77,410.

Question 7: To see if the Town will vote to raise and appropriate $472,753 for the Durham Fire and Rescue Operating Budg-
et. Funding Source: Raise $472,753

2019 Budget 2019 Actual 2020 Budget

ing Source: Raise $31,930 and Transfer $1,006,763 from the Following Revenue Funds: Excise Taxes $952,183 and LRAP
(Local Roads Assistance Program) $54,580.

This budget was significantly decreased in response to the economic environment caused by the pandemic. The Select Board
and Budget Committee voted to decrease spending on road maintenance by half this year. All but $31,930 is transferred from
existing funds. ; a ‘
